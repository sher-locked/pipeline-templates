# The output generated by this tool should be used as a base for further
# modifications. It does not make assumptions as to what things can be made into
# variables, modules, partials or Jinja templates. This is your responsibility as
# the owner of the template.
#
# Some recommendations to massage the initial output:
#
# * Rename the pipeline stage IDs, notification names and trigger names to be
#   more meaningful. Enumerated stage IDs is ultimately a detriment for
#   long-term maintainability.
# * The template is currently ordered, so keys may not necessarily be structured
#   in the most sensible format. You may want to massage the template a little.
